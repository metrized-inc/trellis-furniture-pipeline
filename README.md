<span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 600;">T</span><span style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: 700;">RELLIS</span> is a large 3D asset generation model. It takes in text or image prompts and generates high-quality 3D assets in various formats, such as Radiance Fields, 3D Gaussians, and meshes. The cornerstone of <span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 600;">T</span><span style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: 700;">RELLIS</span> is a unified Structured LATent (<span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 600;">SL</span><span style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: 700;">AT</span>) representation that allows decoding to different output formats and Rectified Flow Transformers tailored for <span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 600;">SL</span><span style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: 700;">AT</span> as the powerful backbones. We provide large-scale pre-trained models with up to 2 billion parameters on a large 3D asset dataset of 500K diverse objects. <span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 600;">T</span><span style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: 700;">RELLIS</span> significantly surpasses existing methods, including recent ones at similar scales, and showcases flexible output format selection and local 3D editing capabilities which were not offered by previous models.

<!-- Installation -->
## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Hardware**: CUDA Device, has been tested on a RTX 3060, 6GB VRAM
- **Software**:   
  - The [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive) is needed to compile certain submodules. The code has been tested with CUDA versions 11.8 and 12.2.  This repo use **CUDA 12.4**.
  - The [VS studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/zh-hans/vs/) with C++ compile needs.

  Give unrestricted script access to powershell so venv can work:

- Open an administrator powershell window
- Type `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted` and answer A
- Close admin powershell window

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repo:
    ```
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/metrized-inc/trellis-furniture-pipeline.git
    ```
## MUST HAVE `--recurse-submodules`

2. Install the dependencies:
    powershell run with `1„ÄÅinstall-uv-qinglong.ps1` (right click then choose `use powershell run`)
    auto install in one-clik

<!-- Usage -->
## HOW TO USE (do these steps in order)
NOTE: Before running any of the scripts, activate the venv with ".venv/scripts/activate"
**1.TRELLIS PIPELINE**
- This pipeline feeds a folder of images to TRELLIS, and then performs some post processing to remove duplicate verticies and auto-unwrap the UV Map
- To run it, use the command "python trellis_and_proccess.py --image_folder='path/to/your/image/folder'"

**2.MANUAL STEP**
- Take the .obj outputted by trellis and load it into Blender or your preferred 3d software
- Assign different materials to different parts of your object (e.g. you can select the legs of a chair out and assign it to another material)
- Export the object as a .glb
- NOTE: The final step can take in a maximum of 3 materials, it expects them to be named "primary", "secondary", and "tertiary". Only a primary material is needed for the last step to work

**3.RETEXTURE PIPELINE**
- This step requires you to setup a .json file that specifies the materials you want to apply
- It should be formatted in the way shown in material-example.json
- Each material can hold the following properties (each should be an image path), only the first one is needed for it to be a valid material: ["diffuse", "roughness", "metallic", "normal", "orm"]. In addition, you can specify the scale with the "scale" property
- To run the pipeline: "python retex_and_bake.py --material_json='path/to/json' --model_path='path/to/your/model'"
- Here is a full list of the flags you can use (only the first two are required):
  --material_json TEXT    Path to the json file that specifies the materials,
                          look at material-example.json for reference.
  --model_path TEXT       Path to the model file (.glb or .obj).
  --hdri_path TEXT        Path to the HDRI image (.exr).
  --hdri_strength FLOAT   Strength of the HDRI lighting. Default is 1.5.
  --texture_size INTEGER  Size of the texture to bake. Default is 4096.
  --denoise BOOLEAN       Whether to use denoising. Default is False. (Seams
                          will appear if set to True)
  --samples INTEGER       Number of samples for baking. Default is 40.
  --help                  Show this message and exit.

## üìö Dataset

We provide **TRELLIS-500K**, a large-scale dataset containing 500K 3D assets curated from [Objaverse(XL)](https://objaverse.allenai.org/), [ABO](https://amazon-berkeley-objects.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html), [3D-FUTURE](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/specials/promotion/alibaba-3d-future), [HSSD](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hssd/hssd-models), and [Toys4k](https://github.com/rehg-lab/lowshot-shapebias/tree/main/toys4k), filtered based on aesthetic scores. Please refer to the [dataset README](DATASET.md) for more details.
